# About phpReel
It's an open-source MIT subscription-based video streaming application built on top of the Laravel Framework. In simpler terms I can say that phpReel is an application that let's you upload video content and distribute it to your users free or via a subscription.

Some of the great features of phpReel:
- Subscription feature powered by Stripe
- Cloud storage with Amazon S3
- Chunk upload and streaming
- Easily customizable with modules and themes
- Dashboard

# Get started with phpReel
I am constantly working on improving every aspect of the CMS, including the way you first get started with it. Check out the [guide on how to get started as a developer](https://developer.phpreel.org/getting-started/quick-start-developer).

# Learn phpReel
Because I know how important is to have a well documented project, phpReel now provides access to its own [documentation](https://developer.phpreel.org/). I am constantly working on it, updating it and generally trying to make it better.

# Contributing
phpReel is getting bigger and better each day, thus with every new feature, it becomes more and more difficult to manage a product without a team. I really want to grow this project into a full-blown software company but until that day I rely entirely on the help of the community. Here is a list of things you can do to help phpReel grow:

- [Fork the project on GitHub](https://github.com/phpreel/phpreel/) and contribute to it by adding new features, fixing bugs, or improving on what's already there (then submit a pull request)
- Spread the word about the project
- Just simply use it and open an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/phpreel/phpreel/issues) if you find any bugs
